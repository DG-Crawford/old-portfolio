A pharmaceutical discovery, research on sleep cycles, and new applications–as a writer and editor, I have researched, written, and published pieces on these topics and more. My versatility and adaptability are keys to my success as a writer. My work includes feature articles, blog posts, website content, marketing communications, and academic writing.

Select highlights of my achievements include:

	Ghostwrote an article published for an entrepreneur-focused column on Forbes magazine. 
	Created SEO-optimized content that boosted the company’s Google search rankings and doubled organic leads.
	Solidified publication’s voice and identity through creation of a definitive style guide. 
	Integrated extensive copy editing and proofreading practices, which virtually eliminated publication errors.

Outcomes such as these are constant across my career and are the result of my leadership and capabilities. For further proof of my writing and editing capabailities, I invite you to view samples of my work at https://dg-crawford.github.io/writing-portfolio/.

I could not have published my online portfolio without the help of others who provide free-use services.
